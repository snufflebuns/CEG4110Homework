Ingredients:
1 (15 ounce) container whole-milk 
ricotta cheese
1/4 cup white sugar 
3 cups half and half
1 cup white sugar
1/4 teaspoon ground cardamom
1/2 teaspoon rose water
1 pinch saffron
1 1 tablespoon chopped blanched almonds
2 teaspoons chopped pistachio nuts

1) Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
2) Blend the ricotta cheese and 1/4 cup sugar together in a bowl with a hand mixer; 
divide the mixture between 12 muffin cups.
3) Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 35 to 40 minutes.
Cool in the pans for 10 minutes before removing to cool completely on a wire rack. Arrange the 
cheese balls onto a dessert platter.
4) While the cheese bakes, pour the half and half into a saucepan and bring to a simmer over low heat;
simmer 10 minutes. Stir 1 cup sugar, the cardamom, rose water, and saffron into the half and half and 
simmer another 2 minutes. Remove from heat and allow to cool completely. 
Drizzle the cooled mixture over the cheese balls. Sprinkle the almonds and pistachios over the 
cheese balls to serve.
